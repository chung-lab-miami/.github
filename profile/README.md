# Chung Lab — University of Miami

Research lab of **Joon Chung, PhD** at the University of Miami.

We study **sleep, health, and behavior** using computational methods — natural language processing, machine learning, and health data science.

## Research Areas

- **Sleep & Public Discourse** — Structural topic modeling of how sleep is discussed in U.S. media and its relationship to public health
- **Actigraphy & Sleep Measurement** — Signal processing pipelines for wrist-worn activity monitors
- **Health AI** — Tracking and analyzing the landscape of AI applications in healthcare
- **Text as Data** — NLP methods applied to large-scale health and media corpora
