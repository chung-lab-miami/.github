# Chung Lab — University of Miami

Research lab of **Joon Chung, PhD** at the University of Miami.

We study **sleep, health, and behavior** using computational methods — machine learning, survival analysis, causal inference, and health data science.

## Research Areas

- **Sleep & Mortality** — PCA-derived composite scores and unsupervised clustering of wearable data to predict survival outcomes
- **Sleep & Public Discourse** — Structural topic modeling of how sleep is discussed in U.S. media and its relationship to public health
- **Actigraphy & Sleep Measurement** — Signal processing and feature engineering from wrist-worn activity monitors
